                    In this tutorial, we are creating a photo shoot effect with our 
                    just-released Photoshoot jQuery plug-in. With it you can convert
                    a regular div on the page into a photo shooting stage simulating
                    a camera-like feel.

                    Potential clients want to see who they'll be working with. They
                    want to hire people, not stock photography. We  produce a custom
                    photo shoot to bring the people of Paterson Buchanan front and 
                    center and to underscore the firm's open and welcome style. Vivid
                    images illustrate Paterson Buchanan's wide range of clients, as well
                    as their comitment to the picturesque region the firm serves
